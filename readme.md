Ridingschool.

This site was created for the owner to gain momentum in the bussiness of horsekeeping and runing a ridingschool.



UX
In making it UX-friendly and curios the page should be able to attract more customers in new segments as per the adventuresection
and also intentionaly leaving out any priceing-info to make the potential customer make contact.

We have all but satisfied customers so far. A greate many of them mentions the full housingexperiance as the usp for them.

As a customer, I want to click once, maybe twice so that I can get the info I need to make a decision on wich action to take.

Moste part of my idea was spawnd in my head, but I did make some notes that can be found, under the name "structure_plan" in the images-folder of this project.

Features
The page is very intuitive in that that it's very clear on what you get when you go through the menues.

Stabel:
This is the "Welcome-page". Here I just breefly go throug what we can offer.

Horsekeeping:
It explains the services you can obtain by leting us keep your horse.

Adventure:
Here we present the three different packages we provide for both kids and adults.

Contact:
This is the keyfeature to get new customers. I hope the page has encouraged them enough to be willing to make contact.

Existing Features
There are mostly text to read. But there is also a video for stimulating purposes.

I'd say this site is a good basestructure for growth.

Features Left to Implement would be booking-abilatys and more ways to cement your decicion.
Another feature idea could be to offer different types of lessons e.g dressage and voltiege.
Technologies Used for payments should be taken into considoration.

I have used HTML5, CSS, bootstrap and fontawesom as language and CDN.

I'm quite convinced that anyone using this site will master it to the full extent on the first try. If you, as a user, are having trouble using this site, I should say that the problem is rooted elsewhere.

Everything works as expected. If you click on the menueitem, you'll be taken to the corresponding page.

Contact form:
It works and returns all the right messages if requirements aren't met.
Everything was tested according to "Mobile first".
No problems were encountered during the tests.


Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
